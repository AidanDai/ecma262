    <h1>Built-in Function Objects</h1>
    <p>The built-in function objects defined in this specification may be implemented as either ECMAScript function objects (<emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-function-objects"></emu-xref>) whose behaviour is provided using ECMAScript code or as implementation provided function exotic objects whose behaviour is provided in some other manner. In either case, the effect of calling such functions must conform to their specifications. An implementation may also provide additional built-in function objects that are not defined in this specification.</p>
    <p>If a built-in function object is implemented as an exotic object it must have the ordinary object behaviour specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref>. All such function exotic objects also have [[Prototype]], [[Extensible]], [[Realm]], and [[ScriptOrModule]] internal slots.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function object has the %FunctionPrototype% object as the initial value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot.</p>
    <p>The behaviour specified for each built-in function via algorithm steps or other means is the specification of the function body behaviour for both [[Call]] and [[Construct]] invocations of the function. However, [[Construct]] invocation is not supported by all built-in functions. For each built-in function, when invoked with [[Call]], the [[Call]] _thisArgument_ provides the *this* value, the [[Call]] _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the NewTarget value is *undefined*. When invoked with [[Construct]], the *this* value is uninitialized, the [[Construct]] _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the [[Construct]] _newTarget_ parameter provides the NewTarget value. If the built-in function is implemented as an ECMAScript function object then this specified behaviour must be implemented by the ECMAScript code that is the body of the function. Built-in functions that are ECMAScript function objects must be strict functions. If a built-in constructor has any [[Call]] behaviour other than throwing a *TypeError* exception, an ECMAScript implementation of the function must be done in a manner that does not cause the function's [[FunctionKind]] internal slot to have the value `"classConstructor"`.</p>
    <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function. When a built-in constructor is called as part of a `new` expression the _argumentsList_ parameter of the invoked [[Construct]] internal method provides the values for the built-in constructor's named parameters.</p>
    <p>Built-in functions that are not constructors do not have a `prototype` property unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.</p>
    <p>If a built-in function object is not implemented as an ECMAScript function it must provide [[Call]] and [[Construct]] internal methods that conform to the following definitions:</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-built-in-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist">
      <h1>[[Call]] ( _thisArgument_, _argumentsList_ )</h1>
      <p>The [[Call]] internal method for a built-in function object _F_ is called with parameters _thisArgument_ and _argumentsList_, a List of ECMAScript language values. The following steps are taken:</p>
      <emu-alg>
        1. Let _callerContext_ be the running execution context.
        1. If _callerContext_ is not already suspended, suspend _callerContext_.
        1. Let _calleeContext_ be a new ECMAScript code execution context.
        1. Set the Function of _calleeContext_ to _F_.
        1. Let _calleeRealm_ be _F_.[[Realm]].
        1. Set the Realm of _calleeContext_ to _calleeRealm_.
        1. Set the ScriptOrModule of _calleeContext_ to _F_.[[ScriptOrModule]].
        1. Perform any necessary implementation-defined initialization of _calleeContext_.
        1. Push _calleeContext_ onto the execution context stack; _calleeContext_ is now the running execution context.
        1. Let _result_ be the Completion Record that is the result of evaluating _F_ in an implementation-defined manner that conforms to the specification of _F_. _thisArgument_ is the *this* value, _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the NewTarget value is *undefined*.
        1. Remove _calleeContext_ from the execution context stack and restore _callerContext_ as the running execution context.
        1. Return _result_.
      </emu-alg>
      <emu-note>
        <p>When _calleeContext_ is removed from the execution context stack it must not be destroyed if it has been suspended and retained by an accessible generator object for later resumption.</p>

      <h1>[[Construct]] ( _argumentsList_, _newTarget_ )</h1>
      <p>The [[Construct]] internal method for built-in function object _F_ is called with parameters _argumentsList_ and _newTarget_. The steps performed are the same as [[Call]] (see <emu-xref href="#sec-built-in-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist"></emu-xref>) except that step 10 is replaced by:</p>
      <emu-alg>
        10. Let _result_ be the Completion Record that is the result of evaluating _F_ in an implementation-defined manner that conforms to the specification of _F_. The *this* value is uninitialized, _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and _newTarget_ provides the NewTarget value.

      <p>The abstract operation CreateBuiltinFunction takes arguments _realm_, _steps_, and _prototype_. The optional argument _internalSlotsList_ is a List of the names of additional internal slots that must be defined as part of the object. If the list is not provided, a new empty List is used. CreateBuiltinFunction returns a built-in function object created by the following steps:</p>
      <emu-alg>
        1. Assert: _realm_ is a Realm Record.
        1. Assert: _steps_ is either a set of algorithm steps or other definition of a function's behaviour provided in this specification.
        1. Let _func_ be a new built-in function object that when called performs the action described by _steps_. The new function object has internal slots whose names are the elements of _internalSlotsList_. The initial value of each of those internal slots is *undefined*.
        1. Set _func_.[[Realm]] to _realm_.
        1. Set _func_.[[Prototype]] to _prototype_.
        1. Set _func_.[[Extensible]] to *true*.
        1. Set _func_.[[ScriptOrModule]] to *null*.
