    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <emu-grammar type="definition">
      SourceCharacter ::
        &gt; any Unicode code point
    </emu-grammar>
    <p>ECMAScript code is expressed using Unicode. ECMAScript source text is a sequence of code points. All Unicode code point values from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, including surrogate code points, may occur in source text where permitted by the ECMAScript grammars. The actual encodings used to store and interchange ECMAScript source text is not relevant to this specification. Regardless of the external source text encoding, a conforming ECMAScript implementation processes the source text as if it was an equivalent sequence of |SourceCharacter| values, each |SourceCharacter| being a Unicode code point. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalization of source text, or behave as though they were performing normalization of source text.</p>
    <p>The components of a combining character sequence are treated as individual Unicode code points even though a user might think of the whole sequence as a single character.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>In string literals, regular expression literals, template literals and identifiers, any Unicode code point may also be expressed using Unicode escape sequences that explicitly express a code point's numeric value. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored as part of the comment.</p>
      <p>ECMAScript differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour of Unicode escape sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A`, for example, occurs within a single-line comment, it is interpreted as a line terminator (Unicode code point U+000A is LINE FEED (LF)) and therefore the next code point is not part of the comment. Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A` occurs within a string literal in a Java program, it is likewise interpreted as a line terminator, which is not allowed within a string literal&mdash;one must write `\\n` instead of `\\u000A` to cause a LINE FEED (LF) to be part of the String value of a string literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot contribute to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a string literal in an ECMAScript program always contributes to the literal and is never interpreted as a line terminator or as a code point that might terminate the string literal.</p>

    <h1>Types of Source Code</h1>
    <p>There are four types of ECMAScript code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Global code</em> is source text that is treated as an ECMAScript |Script|. The global code of a particular |Script| does not include any source text that is parsed as part of a |FunctionDeclaration|, |FunctionExpression|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |GeneratorExpression|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionExpression|, |MethodDefinition|, |ArrowFunction|, |AsyncArrowFunction|, |ClassDeclaration|, or |ClassExpression|.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Eval code</em> is the source text supplied to the built-in `eval` function. More precisely, if the parameter to the built-in `eval` function is a String, it is treated as an ECMAScript |Script|. The eval code for a particular invocation of `eval` is the global code portion of that |Script|.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Function code</em> is source text that is parsed to supply the value of the [[ECMAScriptCode]] and [[FormalParameters]] internal slots (see <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-function-objects"></emu-xref>) of an ECMAScript function object. The function code of a particular ECMAScript function does not include any source text that is parsed as the function code of a nested |FunctionDeclaration|, |FunctionExpression|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |GeneratorExpression|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionExpression|, |MethodDefinition|, |ArrowFunction|, |AsyncArrowFunction|, |ClassDeclaration|, or |ClassExpression|.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Module code</em> is source text that is code that is provided as a |ModuleBody|. It is the code that is directly evaluated when a module is initialized. The module code of a particular module does not include any source text that is parsed as part of a nested |FunctionDeclaration|, |FunctionExpression|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |GeneratorExpression|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionExpression|, |MethodDefinition|, |ArrowFunction|, |AsyncArrowFunction|, |ClassDeclaration|, or |ClassExpression|.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <emu-note>
      <p>Function code is generally provided as the bodies of Function Definitions (<emu-xref href="#sec-function-definitions"></emu-xref>), Arrow Function Definitions (<emu-xref href="#sec-arrow-function-definitions"></emu-xref>), Method Definitions (<emu-xref href="#sec-method-definitions"></emu-xref>), Generator Definitions (<emu-xref href="#sec-generator-function-definitions"></emu-xref>), Async Function Definitions (<emu-xref href="#sec-async-function-definitions"></emu-xref>), and Async Arrow Functions (<emu-xref href="#sec-async-arrow-function-definitions"></emu-xref>). Function code is also derived from the arguments to the `Function` constructor (<emu-xref href="#sec-function-p1-p2-pn-body"></emu-xref>), the `GeneratorFunction` constructor (<emu-xref href="#sec-generatorfunction"></emu-xref>), and the `AsyncFunction` constructor (<emu-xref href="#sec-async-function-constructor-arguments"></emu-xref>).</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-strict-mode-code">
      <h1>Strict Mode Code</h1>
      <p>An ECMAScript |Script| syntactic unit may be processed using either unrestricted or strict mode syntax and semantics. Code is interpreted as <dfn>strict mode code</dfn> in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Global code is strict mode code if it begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Module code is always strict mode code.
        </li>
        <li>
          All parts of a |ClassDeclaration| or a |ClassExpression| are strict mode code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eval code is strict mode code if it begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive or if the call to `eval` is a direct eval that is contained in strict mode code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Function code is strict mode code if the associated |FunctionDeclaration|, |FunctionExpression|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |GeneratorExpression|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionExpression|, |MethodDefinition|, |ArrowFunction|, or |AsyncArrowFunction| is contained in strict mode code or if the code that produces the value of the function's [[ECMAScriptCode]] internal slot begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Function code that is supplied as the arguments to the built-in `Function`, `Generator`, and `AsyncFunction` constructors is strict mode code if the last argument is a String that when processed is a |FunctionBody| that begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>ECMAScript code that is not strict mode code is called <dfn id="non-strict-code">non-strict code</dfn>.</p>

      <h1>Non-ECMAScript Functions</h1>
      <p>An ECMAScript implementation may support the evaluation of function exotic objects whose evaluative behaviour is expressed in some implementation-defined form of executable code other than via ECMAScript code.
