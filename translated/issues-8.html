    <h1>Algorithm Conventions</h1>
    <p>The specification often uses a numbered list to specify steps in an algorithm. These algorithms are used to precisely specify the required semantics of ECMAScript language constructs. The algorithms are not intended to imply the use of any specific implementation technique. In practice, there may be more efficient algorithms available to implement a given feature.</p>
    <p>Algorithms may be explicitly parameterized, in which case the names and usage of the parameters must be provided as part of the algorithm's definition.</p>
    <p>Algorithm steps may be subdivided into sequential substeps. Substeps are indented and may themselves be further divided into indented substeps. Outline numbering conventions are used to identify substeps with the first level of substeps labelled with lower case alphabetic characters and the second level of substeps labelled with lower case roman numerals. If more than three levels are required these rules repeat with the fourth level using numeric labels. For example:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Top-level step
        1. Substep.
        1. Substep.
          1. Subsubstep.
            1. Subsubsubstep
              1. Subsubsubsubstep
                1. Subsubsubsubsubstep
    </emu-alg>
    <p>A step or substep may be written as an &ldquo;if&rdquo; predicate that conditions its substeps. In this case, the substeps are only applied if the predicate is true. If a step or substep begins with the word &ldquo;else&rdquo;, it is a predicate that is the negation of the preceding &ldquo;if&rdquo; predicate step at the same level.</p>
    <p>A step may specify the iterative application of its substeps.</p>
    <p>A step that begins with &ldquo;<dfn id="assert">Assert</dfn>:&rdquo; asserts an invariant condition of its algorithm. Such assertions are used to make explicit algorithmic invariants that would otherwise be implicit. Such assertions add no additional semantic requirements and hence need not be checked by an implementation. They are used simply to clarify algorithms.</p>
    <p>Algorithm steps may declare named aliases for any value using the form &ldquo;Let _x_ be _someValue_&rdquo;. These aliases are reference-like in that both _x_ and _someValue_ refer to the same underlying data and modifications to either are visible to both. Algorithm steps that want to avoid this reference-like behaviour should explicitly make a copy of the right-hand side: &ldquo;Let _x_ be a copy of _someValue_&rdquo; creates a shallow copy of _someValue_.</p>
    <p>Once declared, an alias may be referenced in any subsequent steps and must not be referenced from steps prior to the alias's declaration. Aliases may be modified using the form &ldquo;Set _x_ to _someOtherValue_&rdquo;.</p>

    <emu-clause id=sec-algorithm-conventions-abstract-operations>
      <h1>Abstract Operations</h1>
      <p>In order to facilitate their use in multiple parts of this specification, some algorithms, called <dfn>abstract operations</dfn>, are named and written in parameterized functional form so that they may be referenced by name from within other algorithms. Abstract operations are typically referenced using a functional application style such as OperationName(_arg1_, _arg2_). Some abstract operations are treated as polymorphically dispatched methods of class-like specification abstractions. Such method-like abstract operations are typically referenced using a method application style such as _someValue_.OperationName(_arg1_, _arg2_).</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id=sec-algorithm-conventions-syntax-directed-operations namespace=algorithm-conventions>
      <h1>Syntax-Directed Operations</h1>
      <p>A <dfn>syntax-directed operation</dfn> is a named operation whose definition consists of algorithms, each of which is associated with one or more productions from one of the ECMAScript grammars. A production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have a distinct algorithm for each alternative. When an algorithm is associated with a grammar production, it may reference the terminal and nonterminal symbols of the production alternative as if they were parameters of the algorithm. When used in this manner, nonterminal symbols refer to the actual alternative definition that is matched when parsing the source text.</p>
      <p>When an algorithm is associated with a production alternative, the alternative is typically shown without any &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo; grammar annotations. Such annotations should only affect the syntactic recognition of the alternative and have no effect on the associated semantics for the alternative.</p>
      <p>Syntax-directed operations are invoked with a parse node and, optionally, other parameters by using the conventions on steps 1, 3, and 4 in the following algorithm:</p>
      <emu-alg>
        1. Let _status_ be the result of performing SyntaxDirectedOperation of |SomeNonTerminal|.
        2. Let _someParseNode_ be the parse of some source text.
        2. Perform SyntaxDirectedOperation of _someParseNode_.
        2. Perform SyntaxDirectedOperation of _someParseNode_ passing `"value"` as the argument.
      </emu-alg>
      <p>Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all chain productions have an implicit definition for every operation that might be applied to that production's left-hand side nonterminal. The implicit definition simply reapplies the same operation with the same parameters, if any, to the chain production's sole right-hand side nonterminal and then returns the result. For example, assume that some algorithm has a step of the form: &ldquo;Return the result of evaluating |Block|&rdquo; and that there is a production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        Block :
          `{` StatementList `}`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>but the Evaluation operation does not associate an algorithm with that production. In that case, the Evaluation operation implicitly includes an association of the form:</p>
      <p><b>Runtime Semantics: Evaluation</b></p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">Block : `{` StatementList `}`</emu-grammar>
      <emu-alg>
        1. Return the result of evaluating |StatementList|.
      </emu-alg>

    <emu-clause id="sec-runtime-semantics">
      <h1>Runtime Semantics</h1>
      <p>Algorithms which specify semantics that must be called at runtime are called <dfn>runtime semantics</dfn>. Runtime semantics are defined by abstract operations or syntax-directed operations. Such algorithms always return a completion record.</p>
      <emu-clause id="sec-implicit-completion-values">
        <h1>Implicit Completion Values</h1>
        <p>The algorithms of this specification often implicitly return Completion Records whose [[Type]] is ~normal~. Unless it is otherwise obvious from the context, an algorithm statement that returns a value that is not a Completion Record, such as:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Return `"Infinity"`.
        </emu-alg>
        <p>means the same thing as:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Return NormalCompletion(`"Infinity"`).
        </emu-alg>
        <p>However, if the value expression of a &ldquo;return&rdquo; statement is a Completion Record construction literal, the resulting Completion Record is returned. If the value expression is a call to an abstract operation, the &ldquo;return&rdquo; statement simply returns the Completion Record produced by the abstract operation.</p>
        <p>The abstract operation Completion(_completionRecord_) is used to emphasize that a previously computed Completion Record is being returned. The Completion abstract operation takes a single argument, _completionRecord_, and performs the following steps:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Assert: _completionRecord_ is a Completion Record.
          1. Return _completionRecord_ as the Completion Record of this abstract operation.
        </emu-alg>
        <p>A &ldquo;return&rdquo; statement without a value in an algorithm step means the same thing as:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Return NormalCompletion(*undefined*).
        </emu-alg>
        <p>Any reference to a Completion Record value that is in a context that does not explicitly require a complete Completion Record value is equivalent to an explicit reference to the [[Value]] field of the Completion Record value unless the Completion Record is an abrupt completion.</p>

        <h1>ReturnIfAbrupt Shorthands</h1>
        <p>Invocations of abstract operations and syntax-directed operations that are prefixed by `?` indicate that ReturnIfAbrupt should be applied to the resulting Completion Record. For example, the step:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. ? OperationName().
        </emu-alg>

        <emu-alg>
          1. ReturnIfAbrupt(_someValue_.OperationName()).
        </emu-alg>
        <p>Similarly, prefix `!` is used to indicate that the following invocation of an abstract or syntax-directed operation will never return an abrupt completion and that the resulting Completion Record's [[Value]] field should be used in place of the return value of the operation. For example, the step:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Let _val_ be ! OperationName().

        </emu-alg>
        <p>Syntax-directed operations for runtime semantics make use of this shorthand by placing `!` or `?` before the invocation of the operation:</p>

          1. Perform ! SyntaxDirectedOperation of |NonTerminal|.

    <emu-clause id="sec-static-semantic-rules">
      <h1>Static Semantics</h1>
      <p>Context-free grammars are not sufficiently powerful to express all the rules that define whether a stream of input elements form a valid ECMAScript |Script| or |Module| that may be evaluated. In some situations additional rules are needed that may be expressed using either ECMAScript algorithm conventions or prose requirements. Such rules are always associated with a production of a grammar and are called the <dfn>static semantics</dfn> of the production.</p>
      <p>Static Semantic Rules have names and typically are defined using an algorithm. Named Static Semantic Rules are associated with grammar productions and a production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have for each alternative a distinct algorithm for each applicable named static semantic rule.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified every grammar production alternative in this specification implicitly has a definition for a static semantic rule named Contains which takes an argument named _symbol_ whose value is a terminal or nonterminal of the grammar that includes the associated production. The default definition of Contains is:</p>
      <emu-alg>
        1. For each child node _child_ of this Parse Node, do
          1. If _child_ is an instance of _symbol_, return *true*.
          1. If _child_ is an instance of a nonterminal, then
            1. Let _contained_ be the result of _child_ Contains _symbol_.

        1. Return *false*.

      <p>A special kind of static semantic rule is an <dfn id="early-error-rule">Early Error Rule</dfn>. Early error rules define early error conditions (see clause <emu-xref href="#sec-error-handling-and-language-extensions"></emu-xref>) that are associated with specific grammar productions. Evaluation of most early error rules are not explicitly invoked within the algorithms of this specification. A conforming implementation must, prior to the first evaluation of a |Script| or |Module|, validate all of the early error rules of the productions used to parse that |Script| or |Module|. If any of the early error rules are violated the |Script| or |Module| is invalid and cannot be evaluated.</p>

      <h1>Mathematical Operations</h1>
      <p>Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, negation, multiplication, division, and the mathematical functions defined later in this clause should always be understood as computing exact mathematical results on mathematical real numbers, which unless otherwise noted do not include infinities and do not include a negative zero that is distinguished from positive zero. Algorithms in this standard that model floating-point arithmetic include explicit steps, where necessary, to handle infinities and signed zero and to perform rounding. If a mathematical operation or function is applied to a floating-point number, it should be understood as being applied to the exact mathematical value represented by that floating-point number; such a floating-point number must be finite, and if it is *+0* or *-0* then the corresponding mathematical value is simply 0.</p>
