      <h1>Context-Free Grammars</h1>
      <p>A <em>context-free grammar</em> consists of a number of <em>productions</em>. Each production has an abstract symbol called a <em>nonterminal</em> as its <em>left-hand side</em>, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and <em>terminal</em> symbols as its <em>right-hand side</em>. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>chain production</dfn> is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.</p>
      <p>Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the <dfn>goal symbol</dfn>, a given context-free grammar specifies a <em>language</em>, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.</p>

      <h1>The Lexical and RegExp Grammars</h1>
      <p>A <em>lexical grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar"></emu-xref>. This grammar has as its terminal symbols Unicode code points that conform to the rules for |SourceCharacter| defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-source-text"></emu-xref>. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol |InputElementDiv|, |InputElementTemplateTail|, or |InputElementRegExp|, or |InputElementRegExpOrTemplateTail|, that describe how sequences of such code points are translated into a sequence of input elements.</p>
      <p>Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript <em>tokens</em>. These tokens are the reserved words, identifiers, literals, and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line terminators, although not considered to be tokens, also become part of the stream of input elements and guide the process of automatic semicolon insertion (<emu-xref href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>). Simple white space and single-line comments are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar. A |MultiLineComment| (that is, a comment of the form `/*`&hellip;`*/` regardless of whether it spans more than one line) is likewise simply discarded if it contains no line terminator; but if a |MultiLineComment| contains one or more line terminators, then it is replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar.</p>
      <p>A <em>RegExp grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in <emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>. This grammar also has as its terminal symbols the code points as defined by |SourceCharacter|. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol |Pattern|, that describe how sequences of code points are translated into regular expression patterns.</p>
      <p>Productions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by having two colons &ldquo;<b>::</b>&rdquo; as separating punctuation. The lexical and RegExp grammars share some productions.</p>

      <h1>The Numeric String Grammar</h1>
      <p>Another grammar is used for translating Strings into numeric values. This grammar is similar to the part of the lexical grammar having to do with numeric literals and has as its terminal symbols |SourceCharacter|. This grammar appears in <emu-xref href="#sec-tonumber-applied-to-the-string-type"></emu-xref>.</p>
      <p>Productions of the numeric string grammar are distinguished by having three colons &ldquo;<b>:::</b>&rdquo; as punctuation.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <!-- es6num="5.1.4" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-syntactic-grammar">
      <h1>The Syntactic Grammar</h1>
      <p>The <em>syntactic grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in clauses 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This grammar has ECMAScript tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols (<emu-xref href="#sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars"></emu-xref>). It defines a set of productions, starting from two alternative goal symbols |Script| and |Module|, that describe how sequences of tokens form syntactically correct independent components of ECMAScript programs.</p>
      <p>When a stream of code points is to be parsed as an ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|, it is first converted to a stream of input elements by repeated application of the lexical grammar; this stream of input elements is then parsed by a single application of the syntactic grammar. The input stream is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single instance of the goal nonterminal (|Script| or |Module|), with no tokens left over.</p>
      <p>When a parse is successful, it constructs a <em>parse tree</em>, a rooted tree structure in which each node is a <dfn>Parse Node</dfn>. Each Parse Node is an <em>instance</em> of a symbol in the grammar; it represents a span of the source text that can be derived from that symbol. The root node of the parse tree, representing the whole of the source text, is an instance of the parse's goal symbol. When a Parse Node is an instance of a nonterminal, it is also an instance of some production that has that nonterminal as its left-hand side. Moreover, it has zero or more <em>children</em>, one for each symbol on the production's right-hand side: each child is a Parse Node that is an instance of the corresponding symbol.</p>
      <p>Productions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just one colon &ldquo;<b>:</b>&rdquo; as punctuation.</p>
      <p>The syntactic grammar as presented in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 is not a complete account of which token sequences are accepted as a correct ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|. Certain additional token sequences are also accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only semicolons were added to the sequence in certain places (such as before line terminator characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that are described by the grammar are not considered acceptable if a line terminator character appears in certain &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; places.</p>
      <p>In certain cases, in order to avoid ambiguities, the syntactic grammar uses generalized productions that permit token sequences that do not form a valid ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|. For example, this technique is used for object literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more restrictive <em>supplemental grammar</em> is provided that further restricts the acceptable token sequences. Typically, an early error rule will then define an error condition if "_P_ cannot be <dfn>reparsed</dfn> as an _N_", where _P_ is a Parse Node (an instance of the generalized production) and _N_ is a nonterminal from the supplemental grammar. Here, the sequence of tokens originally matched by _P_ is parsed again using _N_ as the goal symbol. (If _N_ takes grammatical parameters, then they are set to the same values used when _P_ was originally parsed.) An error occurs if the sequence of tokens cannot be parsed as a single instance of _N_, with no tokens left over. Subsequently, algorithms access the result of the parse using a phrase of the form "the result of <dfn>reparsing</dfn> _P_ as an _N_". This will always be a Parse Node (an instance of _N_), since any parsing failure would have been detected by an early error rule.</p>

      <h1>Grammar Notation</h1>
      <p>Terminal symbols of the lexical, RegExp, and numeric string grammars are shown in `fixed width` font, both in the productions of the grammars and throughout this specification whenever the text directly refers to such a terminal symbol. These are to appear in a script exactly as written. All terminal symbol code points specified in this way are to be understood as the appropriate Unicode code points from the Basic Latin range, as opposed to any similar-looking code points from other Unicode ranges.</p>
      <p>Nonterminal symbols are shown in <i>italic</i> type. The definition of a nonterminal (also called a &ldquo;production&rdquo;) is introduced by the name of the nonterminal being defined followed by one or more colons. (The number of colons indicates to which grammar the production belongs.) One or more alternative right-hand sides for the nonterminal then follow on succeeding lines. For example, the syntactic definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        WhileStatement :
          `while` `(` Expression `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>states that the nonterminal |WhileStatement| represents the token `while`, followed by a left parenthesis token, followed by an |Expression|, followed by a right parenthesis token, followed by a |Statement|. The occurrences of |Expression| and |Statement| are themselves nonterminals. As another example, the syntactic definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        ArgumentList :
          AssignmentExpression
          ArgumentList `,` AssignmentExpression
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>states that an |ArgumentList| may represent either a single |AssignmentExpression| or an |ArgumentList|, followed by a comma, followed by an |AssignmentExpression|. This definition of |ArgumentList| is recursive, that is, it is defined in terms of itself. The result is that an |ArgumentList| may contain any positive number of arguments, separated by commas, where each argument expression is an |AssignmentExpression|. Such recursive definitions of nonterminals are common.</p>
      <p>The subscripted suffix &ldquo;<sub>opt</sub>&rdquo;, which may appear after a terminal or nonterminal, indicates an optional symbol. The alternative containing the optional symbol actually specifies two right-hand sides, one that omits the optional element and one that includes it. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer?
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier
          BindingIdentifier Initializer
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        IterationStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression? `;` Expression? `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        IterationStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` Expression? `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` Expression? `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>which in turn is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        IterationStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` Expression `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` Expression `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>so, in this example, the nonterminal |IterationStatement| actually has four alternative right-hand sides.</p>
      <p>A production may be parameterized by a subscripted annotation of the form &ldquo;<sub>[parameters]</sub>&rdquo;, which may appear as a suffix to the nonterminal symbol defined by the production. &ldquo;<sub>parameters</sub>&rdquo; may be either a single name or a comma separated list of names. A parameterized production is shorthand for a set of productions defining all combinations of the parameter names, preceded by an underscore, appended to the parameterized nonterminal symbol. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList[Return] :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList[Return, In] :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_In :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return_In :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>Multiple parameters produce a combinatory number of productions, not all of which are necessarily referenced in a complete grammar.</p>
      <p>References to nonterminals on the right-hand side of a production can also be parameterized. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement[+In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is equivalent to saying:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement[~In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is equivalent to:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>A nonterminal reference may have both a parameter list and an &ldquo;<sub>opt</sub>&rdquo; suffix. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer[+In]?
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier
          BindingIdentifier Initializer_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>Prefixing a parameter name with &ldquo;<sub>?</sub>&rdquo; on a right-hand side nonterminal reference makes that parameter value dependent upon the occurrence of the parameter name on the reference to the current production's left-hand side symbol. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        VariableDeclaration[In] :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer[?In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer

        VariableDeclaration_In :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>If a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with &ldquo;[+parameter]&rdquo; that alternative is only available if the named parameter was used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol. If a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with &ldquo;[\~parameter]&rdquo; that alternative is only available if the named parameter was <em>not</em> used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList[Return] :
          [+Return] ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList[Return] :
          [~Return] ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>When the words &ldquo;<b>one of</b>&rdquo; follow the colon(s) in a grammar definition, they signify that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or lines is an alternative definition. For example, the lexical grammar for ECMAScript contains the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        NonZeroDigit :: one of
          `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>which is merely a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        NonZeroDigit ::
          `1`
          `2`
          `3`
          `4`
          `5`
          `6`
          `7`
          `8`
          `9`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[empty]&rdquo; appears as the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production's right-hand side contains no terminals or nonterminals.</p>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead &notin; _set_]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production may not be used if the immediately following input token sequence is a member of the given _set_. The _set_ can be written as a comma separated list of one or two element terminal sequences enclosed in curly brackets. For convenience, the set can also be written as a nonterminal, in which case it represents the set of all terminals to which that nonterminal could expand. If the _set_ consists of a single terminal the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead &ne; _terminal_]&rdquo; may be used.</p>
      <p>For example, given the definitions:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        DecimalDigit :: one of
          `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`

        DecimalDigits ::
          DecimalDigit
          DecimalDigits DecimalDigit
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>the definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        LookaheadExample ::
          `n` [lookahead &lt;! {`1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `9`}] DecimalDigits
          DecimalDigit [lookahead &lt;! DecimalDigit]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>matches either the letter `n` followed by one or more decimal digits the first of which is even, or a decimal digit not followed by another decimal digit.</p>
      <p>Similarly, if the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead &isin; _set_]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production may only be used if the immediately following input token sequence is a member of the given _set_. If the _set_ consists of a single terminal the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead = _terminal_]&rdquo; may be used.</p>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[no |LineTerminator| here]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production of the syntactic grammar, it indicates that the production is <em>a restricted production</em>: it may not be used if a |LineTerminator| occurs in the input stream at the indicated position. For example, the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        ThrowStatement :
          `throw` [no LineTerminator here] Expression `;`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>indicates that the production may not be used if a |LineTerminator| occurs in the script between the `throw` token and the |Expression|.</p>
      <p>Unless the presence of a |LineTerminator| is forbidden by a restricted production, any number of occurrences of |LineTerminator| may appear between any two consecutive tokens in the stream of input elements without affecting the syntactic acceptability of the script.</p>
      <p>When an alternative in a production of the lexical grammar or the numeric string grammar appears to be a multi-code point token, it represents the sequence of code points that would make up such a token.</p>
      <p>The right-hand side of a production may specify that certain expansions are not permitted by using the phrase &ldquo;<b>but not</b>&rdquo; and then indicating the expansions to be excluded. For example, the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        Identifier ::
          IdentifierName but not ReservedWord
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>means that the nonterminal |Identifier| may be replaced by any sequence of code points that could replace |IdentifierName| provided that the same sequence of code points could not replace |ReservedWord|.</p>
      <p>Finally, a few nonterminal symbols are described by a descriptive phrase in sans-serif type in cases where it would be impractical to list all the alternatives:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        SourceCharacter ::
          &gt; any Unicode code point
      </emu-grammar>
    </emu-clause>
  </emu-clause>
