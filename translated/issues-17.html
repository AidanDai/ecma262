    <h1>Lexical Environments</h1>
    <p>A <dfn>Lexical Environment</dfn> is a specification type used to define the association of |Identifier|s to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an <em>outer</em> Lexical Environment. Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a |FunctionDeclaration|, a |BlockStatement|, or a |Catch| clause of a |TryStatement| and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated.</p>
    <p>An Environment Record records the identifier bindings that are created within the scope of its associated Lexical Environment. It is referred to as the Lexical Environment's <dfn>EnvironmentRecord</dfn></p>
    <p>The outer environment reference is used to model the logical nesting of Lexical Environment values. The outer reference of a (inner) Lexical Environment is a reference to the Lexical Environment that logically surrounds the inner Lexical Environment. An outer Lexical Environment may, of course, have its own outer Lexical Environment. A Lexical Environment may serve as the outer environment for multiple inner Lexical Environments. For example, if a |FunctionDeclaration| contains two nested |FunctionDeclaration|s then the Lexical Environments of each of the nested functions will have as their outer Lexical Environment the Lexical Environment of the current evaluation of the surrounding function.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="global-environment">global environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment which does not have an outer environment. The global environment's outer environment reference is *null*. A global environment's EnvironmentRecord may be prepopulated with identifier bindings and includes an associated <dfn id="global-object">global object</dfn> whose properties provide some of the global environment's identifier bindings. As ECMAScript code is executed, additional properties may be added to the global object and the initial properties may be modified.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="module-environment">module environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment that contains the bindings for the top level declarations of a |Module|. It also contains the bindings that are explicitly imported by the |Module|. The outer environment of a module environment is a global environment.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="function-environment">function environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment that corresponds to the invocation of an ECMAScript function object. A function environment may establish a new `this` binding. A function environment also captures the state necessary to support `super` method invocations.</p>
    <p>Lexical Environments and Environment Record values are purely specification mechanisms and need not correspond to any specific artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for an ECMAScript program to directly access or manipulate such values.</p>

    <!-- es6num="8.1.1" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-environment-records">
      <h1>Environment Records</h1>
      <p>There are two primary kinds of <dfn>Environment Record</dfn> values used in this specification: <em>declarative Environment Records</em> and <em>object Environment Records</em>. Declarative Environment Records are used to define the effect of ECMAScript language syntactic elements such as |FunctionDeclaration|s, |VariableDeclaration|s, and |Catch| clauses that directly associate identifier bindings with ECMAScript language values. Object Environment Records are used to define the effect of ECMAScript elements such as |WithStatement| that associate identifier bindings with the properties of some object. Global Environment Records and function Environment Records are specializations that are used for specifically for |Script| global declarations and for top-level declarations within functions.</p>
      <p>For specification purposes Environment Record values are values of the Record specification type and can be thought of as existing in a simple object-oriented hierarchy where Environment Record is an abstract class with three concrete subclasses, declarative Environment Record, object Environment Record, and global Environment Record. Function Environment Records and module Environment Records are subclasses of declarative Environment Record. The abstract class includes the abstract specification methods defined in <emu-xref href="#table-15"></emu-xref>. These abstract methods have distinct concrete algorithms for each of the concrete subclasses.</p>

        <h1>Global Environment Records</h1>
        <p>A global Environment Record is used to represent the outer most scope that is shared by all of the ECMAScript |Script| elements that are processed in a common realm. A global Environment Record provides the bindings for built-in globals (clause <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref>), properties of the global object, and for all top-level declarations (<emu-xref href="#sec-block-static-semantics-toplevellexicallyscopeddeclarations"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-block-static-semantics-toplevelvarscopeddeclarations"></emu-xref>) that occur within a |Script|.</p>
        <p>A global Environment Record is logically a single record but it is specified as a composite encapsulating an object Environment Record and a declarative Environment Record. The object Environment Record has as its base object the global object of the associated Realm Record. This global object is the value returned by the global Environment Record's GetThisBinding concrete method. The object Environment Record component of a global Environment Record contains the bindings for all built-in globals (clause <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref>) and all bindings introduced by a |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration| or |VariableStatement| contained in global code. The bindings for all other ECMAScript declarations in global code are contained in the declarative Environment Record component of the global Environment Record.</p>
        <p>Properties may be created directly on a global object. Hence, the object Environment Record component of a global Environment Record may contain both bindings created explicitly by |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, or |VariableDeclaration| declarations and bindings created implicitly as properties of the global object. In order to identify which bindings were explicitly created using declarations, a global Environment Record maintains a list of the names bound using its CreateGlobalVarBinding and CreateGlobalFunctionBinding concrete methods.</p>
        <p>Global Environment Records have the additional fields listed in <emu-xref href="#table-18"></emu-xref> and the additional methods listed in <emu-xref href="#table-19"></emu-xref>.</p>
