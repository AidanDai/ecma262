    <p>An <dfn>execution context</dfn> is a specification device that is used to track the runtime evaluation of code by an ECMAScript implementation. At any point in time, there is at most one execution context per agent that is actually executing code. This is known as the agent's <dfn id="running-execution-context">running execution context</dfn>.  All references to the running execution context in this specification denote the running execution context of the surrounding agent.</p>
    <p>The <dfn id="execution-context-stack">execution context stack</dfn> is used to track execution contexts. The running execution context is always the top element of this stack. A new execution context is created whenever control is transferred from the executable code associated with the currently running execution context to executable code that is not associated with that execution context. The newly created execution context is pushed onto the stack and becomes the running execution context.</p>
    <p>An execution context contains whatever implementation specific state is necessary to track the execution progress of its associated code. Each execution context has at least the state components listed in <emu-xref href="#table-22"></emu-xref>.</p>

Once the running execution context has been suspended a different execution context may become the running execution context and commence evaluating its code. At some later time a suspended execution context may again become the running execution context and continue evaluating its code at the point where it had previously been suspended.

    <p>A Job Queue is a FIFO queue of PendingJob records. Each Job Queue has a name and the full set of available Job Queues are defined by an ECMAScript implementation. Every ECMAScript implementation has at least the Job Queues defined in <emu-xref href="#table-26"></emu-xref>.</p>
    <p>Each agent has its own set of named Job Queues.  All references to a named job queue in this specification denote the named job queue of the surrounding agent.</p>

    <p>A request for the future execution of a Job is made by enqueueing, on a Job Queue, a PendingJob record that includes a Job abstract operation name and any necessary argument values. When there is no running execution context and the execution context stack is empty, the ECMAScript implementation removes the first PendingJob from a Job Queue and uses the information contained in it to create an execution context and starts execution of the associated Job abstract operation.</p>
    <p>The PendingJob records from a single Job Queue are always initiated in FIFO order. This specification does not define the order in which multiple Job Queues are serviced. An ECMAScript implementation may interweave the FIFO evaluation of the PendingJob records of a Job Queue with the evaluation of the PendingJob records of one or more other Job Queues. An implementation must define what occurs when there are no running execution context and all Job Queues are empty.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>Typically an ECMAScript implementation will have its Job Queues pre-initialized with at least one PendingJob and one of those Jobs will be the first to be executed. An implementation might choose to free all resources and terminate if the current Job completes and all Job Queues are empty. Alternatively, it might choose to wait for a some implementation specific agent or mechanism to enqueue new PendingJob requests.</p>

    <p>The following abstract operations are used to create and manage Jobs and Job Queues:</p>

    <!-- es6num="8.4.1" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-enqueuejob" aoid="EnqueueJob">
      <h1>EnqueueJob ( _queueName_, _job_, _arguments_ )</h1>
      <p>The EnqueueJob abstract operation requires three arguments: _queueName_, _job_, and _arguments_. It performs the following steps:</p>
      <emu-alg>
        1. Assert: Type(_queueName_) is String and its value is the name of a Job Queue recognized by this implementation.
        1. Assert: _job_ is the name of a Job.
        1. Assert: _arguments_ is a List that has the same number of elements as the number of parameters required by _job_.
        1. Let _callerContext_ be the running execution context.
        1. Let _callerRealm_ be _callerContext_'s Realm.
        1. Let _callerScriptOrModule_ be _callerContext_'s ScriptOrModule.
        1. Let _pending_ be PendingJob{ [[Job]]: _job_, [[Arguments]]: _arguments_, [[Realm]]: _callerRealm_, [[ScriptOrModule]]: _callerScriptOrModule_, [[HostDefined]]: *undefined* }.
        1. Perform any implementation or host environment defined processing of _pending_. This may include modifying the [[HostDefined]] field or any other field of _pending_.
        1. Add _pending_ at the back of the Job Queue named by _queueName_.
        1. Return NormalCompletion(~empty~).

    </emu-clause>
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="sec-initializehostdefinedrealm" aoid="InitializeHostDefinedRealm">
    <h1>InitializeHostDefinedRealm ( )</h1>
    <p>The abstract operation InitializeHostDefinedRealm performs the following steps:</p>

    <emu-alg>
      1. Let _realm_ be CreateRealm().
      1. Let _newContext_ be a new execution context.
      1. Set the Function of _newContext_ to *null*.
      1. Set the Realm of _newContext_ to _realm_.
      1. Set the ScriptOrModule of _newContext_ to *null*.
      1. Push _newContext_ onto the execution context stack; _newContext_ is now the running execution context.
      1. If the host requires use of an exotic object to serve as _realm_'s global object, let _global_ be such an object created in an implementation-defined manner. Otherwise, let _global_ be *undefined*, indicating that an ordinary object should be created as the global object.
      1. If the host requires that the `this` binding in _realm_'s global scope return an object other than the global object, let _thisValue_ be such an object created in an implementation-defined manner. Otherwise, let _thisValue_ be *undefined*, indicating that _realm_'s global `this` binding should be the global object.
      1. Perform SetRealmGlobalObject(_realm_, _global_, _thisValue_).
      1. Let _globalObj_ be ? SetDefaultGlobalBindings(_realm_).
      1. Create any implementation-defined global object properties on _globalObj_.
      1. Return NormalCompletion(~empty~).
    </emu-alg>

  <emu-clause id="sec-runjobs" aoid="RunJobs">
    <h1>RunJobs ( )</h1>
    <p>The abstract operation RunJobs performs the following steps:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Perform ? InitializeHostDefinedRealm().
      1. In an implementation-dependent manner, obtain the ECMAScript source texts (see clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-source-code"></emu-xref>) and any associated host-defined values for zero or more ECMAScript scripts and/or ECMAScript modules. For each such _sourceText_ and _hostDefined_, do
        1. If _sourceText_ is the source code of a script, then
          1. Perform EnqueueJob(`"ScriptJobs"`, ScriptEvaluationJob, &laquo; _sourceText_, _hostDefined_ &raquo;).
        1. Else _sourceText_ is the source code of a module,
          1. Perform EnqueueJob(`"ScriptJobs"`, TopLevelModuleEvaluationJob, &laquo; _sourceText_, _hostDefined_ &raquo;).
      1. Repeat,
        1. Suspend the running execution context and remove it from the execution context stack.
        1. Assert: The execution context stack is now empty.
        1. Let _nextQueue_ be a non-empty Job Queue chosen in an implementation-defined manner. If all Job Queues are empty, the result is implementation-defined.
        1. Let _nextPending_ be the PendingJob record at the front of _nextQueue_. Remove that record from _nextQueue_.
        1. Let _newContext_ be a new execution context.
        1. Set _newContext_'s Function to *null*.
        1. Set _newContext_'s Realm to _nextPending_.[[Realm]].
        1. Set _newContext_'s ScriptOrModule to _nextPending_.[[ScriptOrModule]].
        1. Push _newContext_ onto the execution context stack; _newContext_ is now the running execution context.
        1. Perform any implementation or host environment defined job initialization using _nextPending_.
        1. Let _result_ be the result of performing the abstract operation named by _nextPending_.[[Job]] using the elements of _nextPending_.[[Arguments]] as its arguments.
        1. If _result_ is an abrupt completion, perform HostReportErrors(&laquo; _result_.[[Value]] &raquo;).
