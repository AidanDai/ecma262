        <h1>Applying the `*` Operator</h1>
        <p>The `*` |MultiplicativeOperator| performs multiplication, producing the product of its operands. Multiplication is commutative. Multiplication is not always associative in ECMAScript, because of finite precision.</p>
        <p>The result of a floating-point multiplication is governed by the rules of IEEE 754-2008 binary double-precision arithmetic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If either operand is *NaN*, the result is *NaN*.
          </li>
          <li>

            In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity nor *NaN* is involved, the product is computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round to nearest, ties to even mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result is then a zero of appropriate sign.

If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows; the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of the appropriate sign.

        <h1>Applying the `%` Operator</h1>
        <p>The `%` |MultiplicativeOperator| yields the remainder of its operands from an implied division; the left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor.</p>
        <emu-note>
          <p>In C and C++, the remainder operator accepts only integral operands; in ECMAScript, it also accepts floating-point operands.</p>

        <p>The result of a floating-point remainder operation as computed by the `%` operator is not the same as the &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; operation defined by IEEE 754-2008. The IEEE 754-2008 &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; operation computes the remainder from a rounding division, not a truncating division, and so its behaviour is not analogous to that of the usual integer remainder operator. Instead the ECMAScript language defines `%` on floating-point operations to behave in a manner analogous to that of the Java integer remainder operator; this may be compared with the C library function fmod.</p>
        <p>The result of an ECMAScript floating-point remainder operation is determined by the rules of IEEE arithmetic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If either operand is *NaN*, the result is *NaN*.

            If the dividend is an infinity, or the divisor is a zero, or both, the result is *NaN*.

          <li>
            If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the result equals the dividend.

          <li>
            If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is nonzero and finite, the result is the same as the dividend.

          <li>
            In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor *NaN* is involved, the floating-point remainder r from a dividend n and a divisor d is defined by the mathematical relation r = n - (d &times; q) where q is an integer that is negative only if n/d is negative and positive only if n/d is positive, and whose magnitude is as large as possible without exceeding the magnitude of the true mathematical quotient of n and d. r is computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754-2008 round to nearest, ties to even mode.
